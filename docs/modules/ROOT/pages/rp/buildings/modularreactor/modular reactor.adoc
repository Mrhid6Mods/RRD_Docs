= Modular Reactors

== Introduction:
Modular Reactor is designed to fit with the Modularity of the existing mod buildings like Modular Power.

Modular Reactors are the direct replacement to **ARC Reactors**.

In version 3.1.0 this will be the first iteration of Modular Reactors, future plans are to add different variants to the existing components.
One future concept is to add a different reactor chamber to allow more power production.


== Modules:

* Foundation
* Support Ring
* Reactor Chambers
* Cooling System
* Heat Shielding
* IO Ports
 


== Modes
There are 3 possible modes for the Reactor to operate in.
In all modes there is a *spin up time* starting the reactor and changing the reactor clock setting

Overclocking the Reactor above 100% (or 150% with coolant) will result in the reactor gaining heat , reaching the max temperature will cause the reactor to trigger an emergency shutdown
Underclocking the reactor will cause it to loose heat.

[NOTE]
====
You can see the current Reactor Heat in the Reactor Foundation screen, you can see the heat per cycle in the IO Modules screen
====

== Stats

These stats are with shielding MK. 3 rings and Reactor Cooling rings with coolant

=== Power only
In power only mode the reactor will only output power to the power grid

=== Steam only
In Steam Mode the Reactor using its internal heat to convert water into Compressed Steam to use in the Super HV Turbine

====Reactor Stats

The reactor clock set to 150% will maintain the current heat level inside the reactor the fuel usage will be stable at this clock setting

[Note]
====
These are very close values taken at the around start of the cycle, and will vary due to being heat dependant and the fluctuations in the reactors internal heat.
====

=== Power and Steam

In Dual output mode, you decrease the production in Single output mode to split the energy from the cores to be able to output both compressed steam and power from a single reactor ring.

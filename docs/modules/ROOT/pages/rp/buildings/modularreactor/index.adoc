=Modular Reactors

Modular Reactor is designed to fit with the Modularity of the existing mod buildings like Modular Power.

The Modular Reactor allows for Massive amounts of power to be generated but the reactor will only take DT Reactor Cores or Deanorium Reactor Cores

although the reactor doesn't need coolant, its threshold before it starts generating excess internal heat will be lower and thus you wont be able to produce as much stable power as you would with coolant


== Modules:

* Foundation
* Support Ring
* Reactor Chambers
* Cooling System
* Heat Shielding
* IO Ports

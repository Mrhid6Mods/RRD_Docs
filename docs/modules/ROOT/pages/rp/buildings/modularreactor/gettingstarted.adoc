= Getting Started

* Place Foundation
* Place Support Ring on Foundation
* Place Reactor Chambers on Support Ring
* Add Support Ring Modules (Cooling, Shielding, IO Ports)

== What each component does

=== Foundation

The foundation is the base for the reactor stack, Reactor Support Rings can be attached to foundation allowing stacking of max 5 Support Rings.

=== Support Ring

The Reactor Support Ring is the brains of the reactor. The Support ring hold information about what is attached to it (Reactor Modules).

=== Reactor Chamber Module

Reactor Chambers are snapped to the Support Ring, 10 in total for the reactor to function.

=== Reactor Cooling Module

Reactor Cooling is snapped to the Support Ring, Allowing for better cooling of the reactor.

=== Reactor Shielding Module

Reactor Shielding is snapped to the Support Ring, Allowing for better thermal dissipation.

=== Reactor IO Module

IO is snapped to the Support Ring, Allowing for automation of fuel, water and reactor coolant.

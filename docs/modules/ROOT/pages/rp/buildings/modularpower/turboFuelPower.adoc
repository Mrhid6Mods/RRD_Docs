= Building a closed loop TurboFuel Plant

This will detail how to build a closed-loop turbo fuel power plant providing 22.5 GW of power.

Input required:

* 240 m³/min Compressed Coal
* 540 m³/min Crude Oil
* 225 m³/min Limestone
* Startup water - a single water extractor could be used to charge the Industrial Fluid Buffer to 50% - 75% full.

Byproducts :

* 270 m³/min Polymer Resin
* 2 025 m³/min Carbon Dust

[NOTE]
====
The listed resources only cover the buildings. Foundations, walls, conveyor belts, and piping are an extra expense. Also ignored is the energy and buildings required to handle the produced byproducts.

* Mk.3 Belts can be used everywhere.
* Mk.1 Pipes can be used for CO₂, Turbo Fuel and Low Pressure Steal -> H₂0.
* Mk.2 Pipes are required for Fuel, Crude Oil, and H₂0 input.
* There is no downside of using Mk.2 Pipes throughout other than more expense
====

== Requirements

Unlocked :

* Earlier Items from the Basic Setup
* Turbo Fuel (MAM Sulfur Research)
* Mk.2 Boiler (Tier 5)
* Mk.2 Turbine (Tier 5)
* MV Generator (Tier 5)
* Solution Heater (Tier 6)

== Producing Turbo Fuel

You will need to produce 300 m³/min of Turbo Fuel, achievable with 9.6 Assemblers with the following

* 240 m³/min Coal (Mk2 Miner @100% Pure Node)
* 240 m³/min Sulfur (Mk2 Miner @100% Pure Node)

| Reinforced Iron Plate | 8 | 80
| Rotor | 4 | 40
| Cable | 10 | 100
| Power | 15 MW | 142.6 MW
|===

Next, obtain 540 m³/min of crude oil - in my example that's 2 extractors running @150%, one on a Pure node, the other on a Normal node.

* 9 Refineries @ 100% with the "Fuel" recipe
* 16 Refineries @ 100% with the "Turbo Fuel" recipe

== Producing Steam

The following is separated into 15 modules, each with 5 generators as the math works best for that.

=== Low Pressure Steam to H₂0

If you should prefer not to build this as a closed loop, you will need 2 Steam Cooling Towers per module, *and* 450 m³/min of water input.

For a closed loop, you will want a fluid buffer as well

==== Industrial Fluid Buffer, 15 total

There is a space vs. power trade off available here.  Each module needs 7.5 Refineries worth of production - you can do it in many ways, detailed here.


==== 8 Refineries - 7 @ 100%, 1 @ 50%

== Consumed Power vs. Generated

The following is consumed in every situation

[%header, cols="2e,>1,>1"]
|===
^| Procedure ^| Power ^| Percentage
| Compressed Coal | 142.6 MW | 0.6%
| Turbo Fuel | 750 MW | 3.3%
| Carbon Dust | 307.4 MW | 1.3%
s| Total s| 1 200 MW s| 5.2%
|===

And either of :

[%header, cols="2e,>1,>1,>1"]
|===
^| Procedure ^| Power ^| Percentage ^| Net
| 3 Refinery option | 4 532 MW | 20% | 16 700 MW
| 5 Refinery option | 3 845 MW | 17% | 17 400 MW
| 7.5 Refinery option | 3 330 MW | 14.8% | 17 900 MW
|===

Given the small difference between the 7.5 and 5 Refinery versions, if you have the power shards, it seems the 5 building option is a better use of space and will simplify piping.

This table assumes the use of the 7.5 Refinery option for handling steam (no power shards)

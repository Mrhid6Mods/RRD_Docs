== Introduction:
Ficsit pioneers can now have refined power production that can provide a variety of power generators either to power your outposts or power your main factories.

== Multiplayer support:

Refined Power has always had multiplayer support as a high priority for any update and this will not change in the slightest. To make sure that playing with your friends is possible and to have a fun experience! While multiplayer support isn't 100% finished yet, we do hope we can fix these little bugs in the future!

== Note on this documentation

To avoid confusion in terms of number formats, the following format is used: +
The .{nbsp}(dot) is used as decimal separator, e.g. in 3.333{nbsp}m続. +
The _space_ is used as thousands separator, e.g. in 3{nbsp}333{nbsp}m続.

Consumption and production rates are always given in _unit_/min unless otherwise noted, e.g. 5{nbsp}m続 means 5{nbsp}m続 per Minute.
